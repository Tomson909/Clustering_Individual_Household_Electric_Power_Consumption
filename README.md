This directory applies clustering and some data analysis on a dataset which contains the electric power consumption data from a household near france.
This Data was taken from [UCI Machine Learning Repository]{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption}. With this directory I document my portfolio examination at my university.
